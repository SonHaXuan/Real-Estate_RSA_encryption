# Real estate based on the Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for the real estate system based on blockchain, smart contract, NFT, and IPFS. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a script that deploys that contract, generate the NFT and deploy them on the IPFS system.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
